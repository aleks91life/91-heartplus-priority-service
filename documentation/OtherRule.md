# Other Rule

## Patient Specific Rule
When checked this will provide the doctor with a dropdown of all of his/her patients, where they can choose one or more of them to have the rule apply only to them.

## Filters
The user can choose from type Patient and type Interrogation filters, which can be checked in two ways: either all of the conditions have to be met, or at least one of the conditions has to be met. These two types of filters are documented in the PatientFilter.md and InterrogationFilter.md

## Excluded Patients
If the Patient Specific checkbox is not checked, the user has the option to exclude certain patients from the rule.

## Tags
The user can specify tags for the rule, which are used to filter, group, and/or categorize transmissions. There are four options to choose from: BATTERY, VT, LEADS, AFIB.
